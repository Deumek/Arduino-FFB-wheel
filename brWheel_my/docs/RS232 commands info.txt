This txt file contains a list of all available RS232 serial interface commands implemented in my latest Arduino Leonardo FFB wheel firmware version (you can use this info to make your own control UI)

Arduino boards are also recognized as a serial communication device due to FTDI chip CH340 and drivers, through which we can send or receive commands from the microcontroler

RS232,   commands are not case sensitive (in this manual cappital letters are used)
         some commands do not have any parameter following a letter, but if they have, a range of available input values will be shown
         all commands must be terminated with CR: carriage return - char(13)
         arduino terminates all responses at CR+LF: both carriage return - char(13) and line feed - char(10)
         some commands have response and some don't (null means no response in this txt file)
         most commands can apply changes right away, but some require Arduino restart (for PWM settings - reconfiguration of internal timer registers is neccessary)
         if a restart is needed, do not send any additional commands before restart
         firmware will check if any command is received every 10ms (100 times per second)
         usual Arduino response time is within few ms
         at each startup firmware will automaticaly configure all settings from EEPROM (for load cell - it will take 2 sec to do tare zeroing)
         FFB clip LED will quickly blink 3 times to indicate that everything is loaded, configured and ready

version, i tried to put some logic in firmware naming, so here is some basic explanation:
         fw-vXX,  two digits only are a test versions of new firmware features
         fw-vXX0, three digits ending with 0 - the basic firmware with no external devices support, except for optical encoder
         fw-vXX1, three digits ending with 1 - adds support for external button box
         fw-vXX2, three digits ending with 2 - adds support for both external button box and load cell
         fw-vXX3, three digits ending with 3 - adds support for external button box, load cell and two external 12bit DAC - MCP4725

options, firmware version include some letter after 2 or 3 digit number, here is what they mean:
         a - pedal autocalibration enabled
         z - encoder z-index support
         h - enabled Hat Switch (uses first 4 buttons from button box)
         s - enabled external 12bit ADC - ADS1105 (for analog inputs)
         d - enabled external 12bit DAC - MCP4725 (for analog FFB output)
         m - replacement pinouts for ProMicro (for FFB clipping LED and buttons 3,4)

[1] all wheel parameters read out
received numbers are: wheel rotation angle, general, damper, friction, constant, 
periodic, spring, inertia, autocenter spring and end stop spring effect gains,
min PWM, brake pressure, desktop effects, max PWM, CPR and PWM settings
command		example response
U		1080 100 50 50 100 100 100 50 70 0 0 45 1 500 2400 9

[2] show firmware version
command		example response
V		fw-v172ah

[3] show wheel, encoder and calibration states
0 - not calibrated or no z-index found
1 - calibrated or z-index found
2 - calibration error
command		example response
S		1			

[4] re-calibrate wheel
for firmware without "z" option, this procedure will try to rotate wheel to the right untill a mechanical end stop is detected
do not use this command if you do not have a mechanical limits for wheel rotation installed, you can use center command instead
for firmware with "z" option, this procedure will rotate the wheel untill a z-index pulse from encoder is detected
at the position of z-index a 0deg value will be assigned, return the wheel by hand to center and send center command
this will save the z-index pulse position in EEPROM and on next powerup as soon as z-index is detected the wheel will be autocentered
command		example response
R		null

[5] adjust load cell brake pressure calibration factor (valid for fw-v XX2 only, for all other it becomes a *PWM balance slider)
sent and received number is only a relative value
each load cell will have a different max force
value of 4 will give 1:1 reading from HX711 24bit ADC chip
*PWM balance slider - you can compensate for example if motor has stronger pull in one direction
value	leftPWM(%)	rightPWM (%)
1	100    		50
128	100		100
255	50		100
command		example response	range
B 45		1			1-255

[6] re-calibrate pedals
will reset pedal axis auto-calibration
if load cell is used for brake it will not affect its calibration factor and will only reset throttle and clutch
if no load cell is used reset will be done for brake axis as well
command		example response	range
P		1			null

[7] optical encoder CPR (PPR) adjustment
sent and received number is CPR - counts per revolution of optical encoder shaft
encoders usualy have specified PPR - pulses per revolution
CPR = 4 * PPR * X
X=1 if encoder is directly mounted to the wheel rim, otherwise it is a gear ratio between encoder and wheel shafts
command		example response	range
O 2400		1			4-600000

[8] re-center wheel
use this command to reset 0deg position of your wheel rim (after you manualy centering the wheel)
this will be required each time arduino is powered on or reset, but it's very quick and easy to do
for HEX firmware with "z" option enabled, the response is the value of z-index offset in the units of encoder CPR
command		example response	range
C		from -CPR to +CPR	null

[9] adjust wheel rotation angle 
sent and received number is in degrees (lock-to-lock)
command		example response	range
G 900		1			30-1800

[10] adjust desktop effects
byte, bit0-autocentering spring, bit1-damper, bit2-inertia, bit3-friction, bit4-ffb monitor, bits 5-7 are unused
bit0 - is LSB (lowest significant bit)
sent and received number is a decimal equivalent (form) of this byte
command		example response	range
E 1		1			0-31

[11] adjust PWM settings - requires Arduino restart in order to apply changes (press reset button, or just re-plug Arduino to USB port)
byte, bit0-phase correct (or fast mode), bit1-dir enabled (or pwm+-), bits 2-5 are frequency select, bits 6-7 are unused
for available frequency selection see firmware info.txt
sent number is a decimal equivalent (form) of this byte
received number is PWM resolution (max number of PWM steps, for this PWM frequency and PWM type)
the settings will be stored in EEPROM right away (no additional saving is neccesary with command A)
command		example response	range
W 5		400			0-39

[12] store all FFB parameter settings in EEPROM (stores everything except for PWM settings)
command		example response
A		1
